              <p>In this post I will briefly talk about the state of my current projects and changes in this website.</p>         
              
              <p>Fishing Game: I have not gave up on the project, all the base features are done.
                Current problem is find a way to host or deploy it</p>
              
              <p>This website: I will be working on upgrade this website as it haves a lot of faults. I also would like to find a better way
                to write this blogs because writing from VScode is not very comfy. 
              </p>

              <p>PlantDB: This is the last project I have been working on. Like the name suggest, it will be related to plants and it will probably
                end up being a docker.
